Irate passengers, however, saw the incident in a different light."All passengers on the flight from CDMX [Mexico City] to Guatemala [flight] AM 0672 state that the passenger on board who opened the emergency window was for the protection of everyone, with the support of everyone, since the delay and lack of air created dangerous conditions for the health of the passengers," the handwritten note by fellow passengers reads."He saved our lives," they wrote - and added their names and signatures to the note distributed on social media.You may also want to read:US investigates why plane idled on tarmac in heatwaveUntrained passenger lands plane as pilot falls illRussian plane lands on frozen river by mistakeWatch: An eyewitness filmed the moment the woman ran up to the plane's cockpitAviation accidents and incidentsMexico CityGuatemala CityMexicoAir travelRelatedNominations sought for Amy Johnson Cup for CourageHumbersideSmall plane crashes into back garden of houseWalesBolts missing from door, says Boeing blowout probeBusinessMoreCanada reimposes visas requirements for MexicansCanada has seen a surge of asylum claims from the country, many of which are withdrawn or rejected.US & CanadaDrunken air rage is putting passengers and staff at risk - unionTwo recent flights from Edinburgh to Tenerife have seen passengers arrested.ScotlandFamily lose £165 Ryanair check-in disputeAn airline dispute resolution scheme ruled that Damian Lloyd had checked out his family.BusinessWhere do Biden and Trump differ on immigration?Biden's efforts to dismantle Trump's policies have proved difficult amid record migrant numbersUS & CanadaBoy spends dream day at airportEight-year-old Max wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority to say he wanted to build his own airport.TyneHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthVideoLiveBBC ShopBBC in other languagesTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices/ Do Not Sell My InfoCopyright 2024 BBC.
